## Event planning playbook

**Roles**:

‚Äã 1 x Instructor and event-responsible individual

‚Äã 1 x Onsite coordinator (student greeting, student wrangling, catering, building access, equipment installation)

‚Äã 1 x Marketing (promotion to external teams)

### Beginning of lead time (see above)

#### Have secured budget

None of this goes ahead unless there‚Äôs a budget

‚Äã Costs will be equipment, event space, catering, and merch, see below.

#### For physical events: have secured venue and equipment

The venue needs to be quiet (ie not in the middle of a loud event like a Hacker House)

Confirm seating arrangements:

- Desks and chairs facing the instructor. Nobody wants to type while looking sideways sideways.
- Projectors or equivalents:
  - Multiple 90-inch monitor/TVs (one closer to back) as projector equivalents.
  - You can use an HDMI splitter or have an iPad to show Keynote slides on each additional monitor.
  - Actual projectors are generally preferable to monitors as the text size is larger.
- Clicker.

Ideal but not essential: the presenter has two laptops - one for Keynote, the other for their own use during class. Eg, while the students code from a display, the instructor can look up documentation in answer to specific student requests.

#### Before you create graphics

You're welcome to create your own graphics, but please note:

> Nothing should be credited to ‚ÄúSolana.‚Äù Be specific! Solana refers to a blockchain protocol, not any particular organisation. Anything coming from a Solana Foundation-run account is coming from Solana Foundation.

If you are using logos, use your own logo and the [Solana Foundation logo](https://solana.org/branding). Don't use the Solana logo!

#### Luma page up

Create the Luma page by following these steps:

##### Description

Note: if you have ran events previously, use **More** -> **Clone Event** in Luma

From a previous event, update accordingly based on your organization and location!

> ‚Äã‚Äã[YOUR ORGANIZATION] is inviting developers to a [MODIFY DEPENDING ON OFFERING]

> [MODIFY DEPENDENING ON TRAINING OFFERING]The training covers cryptography fundamentals, blockchain, and Solana from the ground up, with frequent hands-on labs. By the end of the bootcamp, attendees will be able to create and transfer tokens, mint NFTs, and build on-chain applications on Solana, the fastest, cheapest, and most scalable blockchain.
>
> The training is aimed at any existing web developer. You'll need to know TypeScript, but you don't need prior cryptography or blockchain experience.
>
> This training is free of charge.
>
> Lunch is provided daily.
>
> Requirements:
>
> - Proficient in TypeScript
> - This is a hands on course, so you'll need a laptop. A Mac or Linux laptop is great, Windows is fine too but you must have WSL2 and Microsoft Terminal installed before class starts.

> We're expecting a large demand for this course, so we've added a few questions during registration. Registering does not guarantee acceptance into the training. If you're accepted we'll see you there!

See previous events: [Nov 2 2024](https://lu.ma/zpoafkgh), [Sep 6 2024](https://lu.ma/wea0og3i), [May 28, 2024](https://lu.ma/850szocc), [Mar 24, 2024](https://lu.ma/ah0v9gwb).

#### Options

Tickets: free

Require Approval: yes

Capacity: 3x attendees (eg, if you want 15 people, limit the event to 45 people) due to flakiness

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Before you publicize the event

**Note**: it will be too late to change these after you get sign-ups so please do all of these **immediately after making the event**.

- In 'Overview' tab, click 'Edit Event', scroll all the way down, and set 'Restrict Location to Guests' (this stops unregistered guests from showing up)
- In 'Registration' tab, add a checkbox question:
  - 'I can commit to all 4 days of training, 10 AM to 4 PM'
  - 'I have a laptop running macOS, Linux, or Windows (Windows must have WSL2 and Microsoft Terminal)'
- Click 'More', 'Event page', and set a nice slug in the Public URL `solana-training-nyc-may-28-2024`. Note: you **must** do this before publicizing your event, as Luma will **not** redirect from the old URL to the new URL if you have it, which will break any links to the original URL.

#### Begin Promotion:

- X/Twitter
  - This should be an ongoing promotion, sent from your own account. Use emojis and get retweets from major ecosystem accounts
- Marketing will help

  - [Offline](https://twitter.com/getofflinexyz) (formerly Solana NYC Alliance)
  - [Solana U](https://www.solanau.org/)
  - [NY Tech Alliance](https://www.nytech.org/)
  - NY [Baddies in Tech](https://www.baddiesintech.com/)
  - NYU Computer Science
  - Other Blockchain groups
  - Local community groups

- Paid ads possibly (while Solana Foundarion does not use paid ads for its own events, other organisations may).
  - A good strategy with paid engagement is to try a few organic posts and use paid engagement as a force multiplier for the posts that organically get popular. Eg, try five pieces of content, pick the one that performs the best after 24 hours, and put a budget behind it for paid engagement.
  - Target the geographic area for the class
  - Target accounts that follow general JS/TS developers, rather than accounts that follow blockchain accounts.

#### Equipment

Tables, chairs, monitors/projectors, clicker:

Screens and keyboard/mice are not needed as students bring their laptops

Confirm room layout, eg:

2 developers fit on a standard (30x72) table. You can physically fit three, but it won't be comfortable. Use two.

```plaintext
            Instructor + TV1

    [ table ][ table ]   [ table ][ table ]
    [ table ][ table ]   [ table ][ table ]
TV2 [ table ][ table ]   [ table ][ table ] TV3
    [ table ][ table ]   [ table ][ table ]
    [ table ][ table ]   [ table ][ table ]
    [ table ][ table ]   [ table ][ table ]

```

### 3 or so days before

Collect the email addresses that replied to the ‚Äòaction required‚Äô email and send them to your building security so attendees can access your building.

### Day before event

#### Room setup

The day of the event it‚Äôs unlikely you will have time for room setup. Students will arrive before the event and want to talk to you.

- Chairs
- Desks
- Power strips
- TV/projector
- Whiteboard, eraser, markers.

#### Telegram Group

Make a Telegram Group for the classroom.

### Morning of event

- **You will have little or no time in the hour before the event.** Someone will inevitably arrive early. Don‚Äôt leave anything to the last minute if you can.
- Onsite coordinator: as people arrive, greet them and let them know about breakfast
- Write the wifi name on the whiteboard - people will arrive late, let them know the Wifi password. Don‚Äôt use a slide for this, or you‚Äôll forever be jumping back and forth to the slide with the WiFi details.

### Delivering content remotely

Keep in mind that when delivering content remotely, distraction is only a tab away.

Use big gestures, vary your tone, and tempo, and joke around, more so than you would in person.

### Training days

In order to put macOS into a mode where:

- Keynote shows the current slide, plus instructor notes, and the next slide
- The TV shows the current slide

#### Display Settings for Projector Use

You need to set display settings on your Mac. **This is not as obvious as it sounds.**

- Pick the TV and set **Use As** to **Stop Mirroring**. Yes that doesn‚Äôt make any grammatical sense.
- You can now extend the display onto the TV.

**![macOS setting up Extended Display](./images/projector-setup.png)**

#### Mouse Pointer Settings

It's also advantageous to use large mouse cursors when presenting (to stop 'losing' your mouse between the projector and your own screen):

**![macOS setting up large mouse cursors](./images/large-mouse-pointer.png)**

#### VSCode settings

Turn off GitHub Copilot - you don't want Copilot suggesting incorrect things while the instructor types and distracting students.

#### Common causes of students having trouble with the labs:

The instructor notes have guides for specific lessons, but watch out for:

- Students with an out-of-date node.js. There‚Äôs a node version check in the slides for this reason. Anything less than node 18 was at the time of writing unsupported by node.js maintainers. Running an out-of-date version will give you errors about strange characters like (`||=`) when reading files.
- Students inconsistently moving between spellings of ‚Äòfavorites‚Äô / ‚Äòfavourites‚Äô during the Anchor lab.
- Editors other than VScode are fine, but you can use your own VScode / Rust Analyzer setup to work out why the code doesn‚Äôt work. Rust Analyzer _will_ make catching bugs easier.
- If you‚Äôre stuck about why a student‚Äôs code doesn‚Äôt work you can also commit their work, paste the correct answer from the `labs` folder and look at the differences in your git client.
- If you don‚Äôt know the answer to a question, that‚Äôs OK, tell the student you‚Äôll chase an answer, and ask your colleagues on Slack.

### Final day

Chase up any items the students have added to the 'to be addressed‚Äô list

Ensure people know of:

- Solana Stack Exchange
- 'Program Examples' repo for Anchor

Essentially you want to make sure they're part of the wider Solana developer community and don't use the class Telegram for technical support!

**If people do ask technical questions on Telegram** direct them to Solana Stack Exchange.

Check for any lost property

Return extra merch/swag to the storage area.

### After the Event

- Check [survey results on the TypeForm](https://admin.typeform.com/form/IPH0UGz7/results#responses)
- Correct any bugs in the course material and or instructor notes

- Send a follow-up email, for example (modify as appropriate):

Send from personal account:

CC: **nobody** (important, don‚Äôt put anyone here as it will reveal ('dox') attendees to each other)

BCC: attendee list
