# Solana Professional Education

This repo is the Solana Professional Education training. It's designed for those thinking about running an event and/or instructing the course.

The training covers cryptography fundamentals, blockchain, and Solana from the ground up, with frequent hands-on labs. By the end of the training, students will be able to create and transfer tokens, mint NFTs, and build simple on-chain applications using Anchor on Rust.

**If you just want to learn Solana**, follow [@solana_devs on X](https://x.com/solana_devs) and we'll let you know when the next course is running in a city near you, or on zoom!

**If you're planning on running a training event** welcome, you're in the right place! This repo has everything you need to plan and teach the course. You can also [contact Mike MacCana](mailto:mike.maccana@solana.org) for help.

## Aims of the training

### Applicable to the widest group of potential Solana developers.

The training requirements are simple: any developer with TypeScript experience. Specifically, no cryptography, blockchain, or Rust experience is required. TypeScript is chosen because it's the language of the JS/TS SDKs, and additionally because understanding strictly typed languages is considered necessary to learn Rust.

**The course is not a beginner course**. Just because the course has low prerequisities does not mean the course is only for beginners. Students will write Anchor / Rust code from scratch, and deploy that code to Solana devnet as part of the course.

### Low time to hello world

People have a limited amount of attention and learning should be focused on the requirements for next task. Anything that isn't relevant to their next task should be removed. If the next task is sending tokens, and JSON RPC knowledge isn't required to perform this task (which it isn't) remove the JSON RPC content.

### Do real things on a real network

We don't need to discuss the benefits of Solana. If a student is attending the course they likely already know that Solana is fast and cheap and has a huge amount of developer and financial activity. We can show the benefits of Solana, live on devnet.

### Students must be able to stand on their own two feet after training is over.

This means students make new projects from scratch, rather than clone existing repos. It also means using the student's own computers rather than sandbox applications like Solana Playground.

### Smaller steps

Student drop-off - which has been high even in some of the best-regarded ecosystem training - often happens when the class moves faster than individual students and the students become so far behind the rest of the group they can't keep up. Smaller steps allow the class to proceed as a group, allow the group to discuss each step in detail, and increase the chances of everyone getting through every exercise.

### Focus on Solana

Many existing Solana courses are slowed down by issues that have nothing to do with Solana. This is not a course in JavaScript frameworks, IIFEs (`;(async function(){})();`), or any other topic.

## Training Offering

**3 days **full-time** in-classroom**, or **10 x 2-hour remote lessons**. We will likely expand this to four 4 days / 13 lessons in the future.

**Audience**: aimed at anyone proficient in Typescript, that wants to learn blockchain.

The aim is to focus on the wider audience of people who want/need to build things, rather than blockchain enthusiasts or Rust programmers. Hence blockchain or cryptography knowledge is not required.

**Student time** is 10 AM to 4 PM.

**Instructor time** is 9 AM to 5 PM.

**Class sizes**: generally between 10 and 15 people - you want to spend time with every student, and larger class sizes get difficult to manage for a single instructor.

**Lead time**: 1-month minimum, ideally six weeks
